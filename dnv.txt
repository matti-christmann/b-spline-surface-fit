questions:

why was I choosen?

structural condition assessment and digital monitoring?

fatigue analyses from full stochastic to presciptive (FLS)

extreme respne covering buckling, collision, extreme loading


experience & passion for programming -> yes

good grades -> yes

further development within finite element analysis discipline -> yes!!!


really looking forward to new learning every project. That's what keep things interesting for me. I've loved doing engineering with pen and paper, but it was time for me to move on!



foster learning, collaboration, and knowledge sharing through challenging projects?
how? -> this is mentioned quite often, but how does this look like in reality?

my position could be in automating FEM analyses - > so computational engineering
maybe also in the area of condition assessment with scanning / working with the data

our formal training programs from (https://www.dnv.no/karriere/opportunities/graduate-in-dnv.html) -> what does this mean?

communication and soft skill courses?
